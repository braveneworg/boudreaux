```

Always run `pnpm run test:run`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run format` before committing.

## TypeScript

- Strict mode — no `any` types, ever. Use specific types, generics, or `Record<string, unknown>`.
- Explicit types on all function parameters and return values.
- `interface` for object shapes.
- Named exports only — no default exports unless there is a compelling reason.
  - Named exports enable better tree shaking, IDE autocompletion, and explicit refactoring.
- Never use the non-null assertion operator (`!`).
- Use `as const` for literal types; prefer over enums. If enums are needed, use `const enum`.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`).
- Use `async/await` with `try/catch` for all async code.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.
- Prefer array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over `for` loops.
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and components.
- Never ignore TypeScript errors or warnings.
- Always use absolute imports (`@/lib/utils`) — never relative imports that traverse up (`../../../lib/utils`).

## Next.js Architecture

- Server Components by default — add `'use client'` only for interactive components (Stripe Elements, dialogs, etc.).
- Server Actions for all mutations (in `src/lib/actions/`). Add `'use server'` directive at top of file.
- Never call services, the Prisma client, or repositories directly from Client Components. Use Server Actions for mutations; for queries, call API route handlers from Client Components.
- Always use the `'server-only'` package in files meant exclusively for server-side execution to prevent accidental client-side imports.
- Use decorators for auth checks (`withAuth`, `withAdmin` from `src/lib/decorators/with-auth.ts`) in API route handlers and Server Actions.
- Prefer TanStack Query for client-side data fetching and caching in interactive components.
- Data fetching in Server Components uses `fetch` with explicit cache options:

```typescript
const res = await fetch(url, { cache: 'no-store' }); // for fresh data
```

- Always validate external data (API responses, user input) with Zod.
- Use Prisma transactions for multi-step DB operations.
- Check database connection health before running DB code; handle connection errors gracefully.

## Components

- Prefer globalThis to window for client-only globals to avoid SSR issues.
- Prefer function declarations; use `React.FC` only when necessary.
- Prefer arrow functions for inline component definitions.
- Never create class components.
- Keep components small and focused — break large files into smaller ones.
- Use props destructuring.
- Use `React.memo` for performance optimization of pure components.
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for memoizing functions and values.
- Avoid inline functions and objects in JSX props.
- Use Fragment shorthand `<> </>` when no key or attribute is needed.
- Always use parentheses for multi-line JSX.
- Before creating a new component, search the codebase for an existing one. Reuse over recreate.
- Check global styles before adding component-level styles.

## Forms

- Always use React Hook Form + Zod for all forms.
- Check `src/app/components/forms/fields/` for existing field components before building new ones.
- Define Zod schemas in `src/lib/validation/`.
- Standard pattern:

```typescript
const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(mySchema),
});
```

- Never skip Zod validation in Server Actions.

## Design & Styling

- Mobile-first on all UI decisions. Never use checkboxes in mobile-first interfaces — use toggle switches or radio buttons for better touch usability.
- Use Tailwind v4 utility classes exclusively. Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Use canonical Tailwind v4 classes — no `@apply`, no inline styles in JSX.
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional class composition.
- Follow shadcn/ui design patterns and variants. Never create new UI primitives — use shadcn/ui.
- Use shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui` whenever possible.
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons.
- Use Jost font for UI text.
- Keep UI consistent with existing components.
- Prioritize accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support.
- Use responsive design principles throughout.

## Naming Conventions

| Artifact            | Convention                         | Example                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Components (file)   | kebab-case                         | `user-profile.tsx`            |
| Components (export) | PascalCase                         | `export function UserProfile` |
| Pages               | folder name                        | `/profile/page.tsx`           |
| API routes          | folder name                        | `/api/auth/route.ts`          |
| Types               | PascalCase `.ts`, filename matches | `User.ts`                     |
| Interfaces          | PascalCase `.ts`, filename matches | `UserProfile.ts`              |
| Enums               | PascalCase `.ts`, filename matches | `UserRole.ts`                 |
| Hooks               | `use` prefix, filename matches     | `useAuth.ts`                  |
| Contexts            | `use` prefix, filename matches     | `useAuthContext.ts`           |
| Services            | PascalCase + `Service` suffix      | `UserService.ts`              |
| Utils               | camelCase name, kebab-case file    | `format-date.ts`              |

- Always use semicolons.
- Always use single quotes for strings (double quotes in JSX attributes).
- Always use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays.
- Use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused.

## Testing

- Vitest 4 for all unit and integration tests; Playwright for E2E (`e2e/` directory, `pnpm run test:e2e`).
- `@testing-library/react` for component tests.
- Test files use `.spec.ts` / `.spec.tsx` suffix, placed adjacent to source files.
- Use `describe`/`it` blocks for organization.
- Target 90–95%+ coverage on all testable files.
- Exclude configuration files, types, interfaces, and Prisma schema files from coverage.
- `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and `vi` are globally available — do **not** import them:

```typescript
// ✗ Never do this
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
```

- Use `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event` to simulate user interactions.
- Use `screen` from `@testing-library/react` to query DOM elements.
- Use `jest-dom` matchers (`toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveClass`, `toHaveTextContent`).
- Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for setup/teardown.
- Mock external dependencies (Stripe, SES, Prisma) at the service layer boundary, not the DB layer.
- Mock behavior — never implementation details.
- Test behavior and output — never implementation details.
- Write separate test cases for different conditions — never use `expect` inside conditionals.
- Use descriptive test names.
- Use `async/await` for async test code.
- Use mock functions for testing callbacks and event handlers.
- Use spies to track function calls and assert on them.
- Don't write brittle or hard-to-maintain tests.
- Don't rely solely on coverage metrics — focus on meaningful tests.

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code, verify:

- Functionality, performance, readability, maintainability, and adherence to these guidelines.
- Potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and unhandled edge cases.
- Code structure, naming conventions, and modularity improvements.
- No secrets or sensitive information committed to the repository.
- Proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Performance optimizations where necessary.
- Test cases cover new behavior and edge cases.
- Documentation is present for complex logic.
- UX/accessibility considerations are addressed.
- No ESLint rules disabled without clear justification.

## Always Do

- Always add the MPL license header from `HEADER.txt` to all new source files.
- Always use absolute imports (`@/lib/utils`), never relative imports that traverse up.
- Always run tests, lint, and format before committing.
- Always write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Always check for existing components before creating new ones.
- Always check global styles before adding component-level styles.
- Always use Zod for runtime validation of all external data.
- Always use the `zod` version from `package.json` (no version drift).
- Always use `'use client'` at the top of Client Component files.
- Always use `'use server'` at the top of Server Action files.
- Always use `'server-only'` in files that must never run on the client.
- Always write accessibility-friendly code (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation).
- Always use `cn()` for conditional class composition.
- Always put AI-generated markdown documents in `docs/copilot/`.
- Always check database connection health before executing DB queries.
- Always use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.

## Never Do

- Never use `any` in TypeScript.
- Never use the non-null assertion operator (`!`).

- Never use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
- Never mix Server/Client Component patterns incorrectly.
- Never skip Zod validation in Server Actions.
- Never use Prisma Client in Client Components.
- Never expose secrets or sensitive information in the codebase or logs or .env files.
- Never disable ESLint or Prettier rules globally or with `eslint-disable` without a documented reason.
- Never import `describe`, `it`, `expect`, or `vi` from Vitest — they are globals.
- Never use `expect` inside conditional statements in tests.
- Never write large files with multiple components or functions — break them down.
- Never ignore TypeScript errors or warnings.
- Never use deprecated APIs or packages.
- Never commit generated files or build artifacts.
- Never mock implementation details in tests — mock behavior.
- Never create documentation from files not located in this repository.
- Never attempt to write DB-interacting code without first verifying the database connection is healthy.
